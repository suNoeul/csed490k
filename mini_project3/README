# Mini Project 3: Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in MPI

This project implements **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life** in parallel using **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**. 
It includes correctness checking using sample input/output files, as well as performance measurement for various process counts.

### Environment
- **Platform**: WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04  
- **Compiler**: g++ (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0  
- **MPI Library**: Open MPI 4.1.2


### Open MPI Installation

To install Open MPI, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
```
Verify the installation:

```bash
mpirun --version    # e.g. mpirun (Open MPI) 4.1.2
which mpicc         # e.g. /usr/bin/mpicc
which mpirun        # e.g. /usr/bin/mpirun
```

## ðŸš€ How to Compile and Run
```bash
# 1. Compile the MPI-based Game of Life
mpiCC -o project3 project3.cpp

# 2. Run with a Sample Input
i=1; mpirun -np 4 ./project3 < ./sample/input${i}.txt > ./sample/my_output${i}.txt

# 3. Verify Output Correctness
i=1; diff -bwi ./sample/output${i}.txt ./sample/my_output${i}.txt
```
If the files are identical, `diff` will return no output (indicating a correct result).

## ðŸ“Š Performance Measurement Script

To benchmark execution time across multiple process counts (`1, 2, 4, 8`), use the provided shell script:

```bash
chmod +x run_experiments.sh
./run_experiments.sh
```

This script performs the following:
- Executes `project3` for inputs `input1.txt` to `input5.txt`
- Varies the number of MPI processes (`-np 1`, `-np 2`, `-np 4`, `-np 8`)
- Measures and logs execution time
- Verifies the correctness of output
- Saves the results to a CSV file named `results.csv`
